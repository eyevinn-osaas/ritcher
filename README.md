# Ritcher

## Open-Source Live SSAI Stitcher

Ritcher is a high-performance HLS stitcher built in Rust for Server-Side Ad Insertion (SSAI). It sits between the origin CDN and the player, dynamically inserting ads into live and VOD HLS streams by manipulating manifests and proxying segments.

Ritcher runs as a standalone Docker container deployable anywhere. It integrates well with the [Eyevinn Open Source Cloud](https://www.osaas.io) ecosystem — particularly as a downstream stitcher for [Channel Engine](https://github.com/Eyevinn/channel-engine) — but has no platform dependencies.

## Features

- **SCTE-35 CUE tag detection** — Detects `EXT-X-CUE-OUT`, `EXT-X-CUE-IN`, and `EXT-X-CUE-OUT-CONT` markers in HLS playlists
- **VAST ad provider** — Fetches and parses VAST 2.0/3.0/4.0 XML from any ad server, with wrapper chain support
- **Static ad provider** — Built-in provider for testing with pre-configured ad segments
- **Slate management** — Fallback filler content when VAST returns no ads or fails
- **Ad interleaving** — Replaces content segments in ad break windows with ad segments, including proper `EXT-X-DISCONTINUITY` tags
- **Master playlist support** — Rewrites variant-stream URLs for multi-quality stitching
- **Segment proxying** — High-performance proxying for content, ad, and slate segments with retry logic
- **Session management** — Per-session stitching with automatic TTL-based cleanup
- **Prometheus metrics** — `GET /metrics` endpoint with request counts, durations, VAST stats, and session gauges
- **Ad conditioning** — Warning-level validation of ad creative compatibility (codec, resolution, MIME type)
- **Error recovery** — Retry logic (1 retry, 500ms backoff) for VAST, origin, and ad segment fetches
- **Demo endpoint** — Synthetic HLS playlist with real Mux test segments and CUE markers for testing
- **JSON health check** — Structured diagnostics with version, session count, and uptime
- **CORS support** — Permissive in dev mode, restrictive in production
- **Docker ready** — Multi-stage Dockerfile for production deployment

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Rust stable (edition 2024)

### Development Mode

```bash
# Start with built-in demo and static ad provider
DEV_MODE=true cargo run

# Demo playlist (raw, no stitching):
# http://localhost:3000/demo/playlist.m3u8

# Stitched demo (with ad insertion):
# http://localhost:3000/stitch/demo/playlist.m3u8?origin=http://localhost:3000/demo/playlist.m3u8
```

### With VAST Ad Server

```bash
# Using Eyevinn test-adserver (or any VAST-compatible ad server)
DEV_MODE=true \
VAST_ENDPOINT="http://localhost:8080/api/v1/vast?dur=[DURATION]" \
cargo run
```

### With Slate Fallback

```bash
# VAST mode with slate fallback when ads unavailable
DEV_MODE=true \
VAST_ENDPOINT="http://localhost:8080/api/v1/vast?dur=[DURATION]" \
SLATE_URL="https://hls.src.tedm.io/content/ts_h264_480p_1s" \
cargo run
```

### Docker

```bash
docker build -t ritcher .

docker run -p 3000:3000 \
  -e PORT=3000 \
  -e BASE_URL=https://stitcher.example.com \
  -e VAST_ENDPOINT=https://ads.example.com/vast \
  ritcher
```

### Production

```bash
PORT=3000 \
BASE_URL=https://stitcher.example.com \
ORIGIN_URL=https://cdn.example.com/stream/playlist.m3u8 \
VAST_ENDPOINT=https://ads.example.com/vast \
SLATE_URL=https://slate.example.com/content \
cargo run --release
```

## API Endpoints

| Endpoint | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `GET /health` | JSON health check (`{ status, version, active_sessions, uptime_seconds }`) |
| `GET /metrics` | Prometheus metrics in text exposition format |
| `GET /demo/playlist.m3u8` | Demo HLS playlist with CUE markers |
| `GET /stitch/{session_id}/playlist.m3u8?origin={url}` | Stitched playlist with ad insertion |
| `GET /stitch/{session_id}/segment/{*path}?origin={base}` | Proxied content segment |
| `GET /stitch/{session_id}/ad/{ad_name}` | Proxied ad segment |

---

## Configuration

| Variable | Description | Required | Default |
|----------|-------------|----------|---------|
| `DEV_MODE` | Enable dev mode with defaults | No | `false` |
| `PORT` | Server port | Prod only | `3000` |
| `BASE_URL` | Stitcher's public URL | Prod only | `http://localhost:3000` |
| `ORIGIN_URL` | Default origin playlist URL | Prod only | — |
| `AD_PROVIDER_TYPE` | `vast`, `static`, or `auto` | No | `auto` |
| `VAST_ENDPOINT` | VAST ad server URL (supports `[DURATION]` and `[CACHEBUSTING]` macros) | For VAST mode | — |
| `SLATE_URL` | Slate fallback content URL | No | — |
| `SLATE_SEGMENT_DURATION` | Slate segment duration (seconds) | No | `1.0` |
| `AD_SOURCE_URL` | Static ad segment source | For static mode | tedm.io test stream |
| `AD_SEGMENT_DURATION` | Static ad segment duration (seconds) | No | `1.0` |

**Auto-detection**: When `AD_PROVIDER_TYPE=auto` (default), Ritcher uses VAST if `VAST_ENDPOINT` is set, otherwise falls back to static.

## Metrics

Prometheus metrics available at `GET /metrics`:

| Metric | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `ritcher_requests_total` | Counter | Total requests by endpoint and status |
| `ritcher_request_duration_seconds` | Histogram | Request duration by endpoint |
| `ritcher_active_sessions` | Gauge | Currently active sessions |

## Why Ritcher?

The SSAI market is growing at 20.3% CAGR toward $14.5B by 2033, yet **no production-ready open-source live SSAI stitcher exists**. Ritcher fills that gap with Rust performance for the CPU-bound work of generating unique manifests per viewer. It works with any VAST-compatible ad server and any HLS origin — deploy it on [Eyevinn Open Source Cloud](https://www.osaas.io) for a turnkey setup with Channel Engine, or run it standalone anywhere Docker runs.
